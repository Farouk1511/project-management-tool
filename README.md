**Task Management**
- Create project
- Projects have 3 states
    -Todo
    -In progress
    -Done
- Each state can have different tasks
- Each state has a 3 priority (low medium and high)
- Create a new task
- ability to move task fron each state
    - a simple option tray should suffice (option to drag and drop later)
    - new task as a default state of todo

**Bankend Design**

- Build apollo server
- create mongodb instance
- create schemas

**App work flow for new users**

- User loads webapp
- user creates new projects
    - Definition of a new project (schema)
        - project name
        - project id (auto from mongodb)
        - project description
        - task array
        - users that have access to projects (coming soon)
        - date created
        - last updated
    - Definition of a new task (schema)
        - Task id (auto)
        - Task title
        - Task description
        - Task status
        - Task creation date
        - Task update date
        - Task priority
- adds new task to project
- changes task status from todo -> in progress -> done
- user can also edit project details
- user can also edit task details
- user can delete project
- user can delete task
- users can add multiple projects and tasks

**ISSUES WHILE DEVELOPING**

- Kept getting cant find findById in the client side code in useEffect. The cause of the issue was me trying to access server side code in the client side. I should have instead created an endpoint on the server to perform the action i want to perform like getting the information on the project or task i need.

*22/07/24*

- Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{ PENDING: string; IN_PROGRESS: string; COMPLETED: string; ARCHIVED: string; }'.
  No index signature with a parameter of type 'string' was found on type '{ PENDING: string; IN_PROGRESS: string; COMPLETED: string; ARCHIVED: string; }' SOLUTION: use type assertion e.g const status: keyof typeof TODO_STATUS 

**TO DO**
